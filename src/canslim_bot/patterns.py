def compute_pivot(df_weekly: pd.DataFrame) -> Optional[float]:
    """
    Detect a cup-with-handle pattern in a weekly OHLCV DataFrame and return the pivot price.

    Pattern rules:
      1) The depth of the last 20 weeks (base) must be â‰¤ 33% from high to low.
      2) The last 3 weeks (handle) closes must be in the upper half of the base.
      3) If valid, return the pivot = max high of the handle; else, return None.

    Args:
        df_weekly (pd.DataFrame): Weekly OHLCV DataFrame (must have 'High', 'Low', 'Close').

    Returns:
        float | None: Pivot price if pattern detected, else None.

    # --- Notes for future improvement ---
    # - Add checks for proper cup shape (U, not V)
    # - Require handle to drift lower or be tight
    # - Confirm volume contraction in base and handle
    # - Add tolerance for minor handle dips below mid
    # - Add minimum base duration (e.g., 7+ weeks)
